This is set of recordings is to record all possible combinations of V, CV, VC, and CVC that are possible
per the pronunciation orthography.

Consonants: c d g h j k l m n s t w y

Vowels: ā ē ī ō ū v̄

The over bar on the vowels is a level tone marker, and is only written when the vowel is
the last sound of a word.

Vowels followed by C are pronounced long and are marked as such.

Vowels not followed by C are pronounced short with some nasalization.

Vowels after n or m are pronounced with nasalization.

The program generate-text.py is used to create the file syllables.txt which was used as the script for recording.
