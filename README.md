_______

This repository contains an implementation of **Tacotron 2** that supports gradient accumulation along with some other modifications from the sourced code to accomplish the goal of generating correct Cherokee language speech using the Uchihara "Modified Community Orthography".

At a later date using Syllabary may be attempted in combination with MCO.
